            <p class="info">
              Studying is more than just a task; it's a passion that I
              wholeheartedly pursue. In my free time, I've immersed myself in
              web development courses through UDEMY, in hopes of creating a
              portfolio worth being proud of.

            <p class="subtitle">What I Did</p>
            <p class="info">
              Throughout my academic journey at University of Melbourne, I had
              the privilege of delving into both the design world and the world
              of code. From collaborating to create beautiful UI to mastering
              the inticacies of algorithms, I have learnt the power of
              collaboration, and relentless weeks of sitting on my ass and
              coding (which, believe it or not, i do enjoy).

            <p class="subtitle">Why Am I Heading Down This Path</p>
            <p class="info">
              After 18 years of studying, the one thing that I've learnt is I
              hold a STRONG AVERSION for writing. I love how I can see my
              creations evolve in real time. Much like when I was engrossed with
              Sims4, creating and upgrading my houses as I go, programming
              offers a continuous sense of achievement. Every meticulous
              placement of an image, every command mastered, IT GIVES ME A SENSE
              OF ACCOMPLISHMENT.
